The project verifies the integrity of the furniture before these detached parts go to build process in the client's property

Screen 1 -> The main screen
  * There you can select a new PDF to start the verification or resume the last work that hasn't finished yet;

Screen 2 -> The monitor screen
  * There you monitor the checking progress, the more you scan the parts, the larger you get the progressbar;
  * If you close the program during the checking, you won't loose your progress;
  
Screen 3 -> The final screen
  * Yet it's just a screen wich indicates that the process of checking is complete;
  * There can have new implementations depending of what the users want;
