### ℹ️ About
This is a starter project to get experience in the developping world, but I would like to make this project useful for possible clients. I made this project for a custom-made furniture enterprise (Forma Sete), and it solves their problem of getting lack of parts when they go to the client's property to build the furniture. In resume this software checks if all the parts are ready to dispatch to the build process in client's property.
